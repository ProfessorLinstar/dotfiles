# Bash `gh pr create` read-replica race (the bug that silently dropped
# foundry/forge#243489).
#
# When Claude creates a PR via `gh pr create` in Bash, the hook used to
# resolve it with `gh pr view <head>` immediately afterward. On a busy repo
# GitHub's read replica lags a few hundred ms, so that view 404s / returns
# empty and the PR was dropped with NO row, NO flag, NO trace — unlike the
# MCP path, which reconstructs from the tool result.
#
# Fix: the Bash path reads the PR URL straight out of `gh pr create` stdout
# (carried in tool_response.stdout) and tracks from it when the view races;
# `gh_pr_view_full` also retries; and a genuine miss is surfaced instead of
# dropped. An empty `gh pr view` here means "no fixture matched" — exactly
# the lagged-replica shape (rc 0, empty stdout).
